Gamepad Libary
==============

This is a simple library whose sole purpose is to provide an easy to
use and portable API for accessing the extremely popular and common
Xbox/Xbox360 gamepads.

Currently supported platforms are Windows and Linux.

Limitations
===========

The library only supports the functions which are compatible with
all OSes.  Primarily missing are:

- Headset/audio support
- XBOX button support (the big button in the middle of the controller)
- LED control support
- Force feedback

Headsets are not supported in Linux via the Xbox controller, and the
big XBOX button and LED control are not supported via Windows.

Force feedback should be available on both, but simply is implemented yet.

Platform Issues
===============

On Linux, hotplug of devices is not currently supported.  All gamepads
must be plugged in when the application starts.  (Or, more accurately,
when the application calls GamepadInit).

Also on Linux, the gamepads must be located in the "new-style"
/dev/input/js* devices.  Likewise, they must be numbed from 0-3
for gamepads 1-4, respectively.  If other joystick devices are plugged
in, they may interfere with gamepad support.

Todo / Roadmap
==============

- Device hot-plugging on Linux.
- OS X support.
- Force feedback / haptics.
- Win32-only headset interaction API.
- non-Win32-only LED/XBOX-button support.
- Feature-detection routines.
